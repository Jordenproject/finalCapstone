## finalCapstone
This project showcases my understanding of object oriented programming with an inventory of shoes. The programme allows the user to search for and manipulate values in the shoe inventory. This is a solution to a real world problem, which allows allows the user to find the lowest and highest quantity of shoes in the inventory and change them accordingly.
