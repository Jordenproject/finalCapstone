## *This project displays my understanding of object oriented programming* 

The programme allows the user to manipulate an inventory of shoe values appended from a text file. The programme allows the user to search for and manipulate values in the shoe inventory. This is a solution to a real world problem, which allows allows the user to find the lowest and highest quantity of shoes in the inventory and change them accordingly.

## What is the project for?
